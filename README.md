# .dotfiles

Current setup: 
1. Clone (don't forget `--recursive`) to ~/.dotfiles
2. Run setup.sh

I intend to make setup.sh really nice and cool using gum and shit but havent bothered yet.

Note: To keep canonical and sensible configs for all of my systems together 
(eg. some of my systems use US keyboards), I will set up a branch for each, 
using their hostnames. For the most part, 
each branch will be a mirror of the master branch, 
which will eventually be modified to be less biased toward my laptop,
with settings that are generic enough to *probably work* on any given system.

As of now, the device specific branches include:

## `kunoichi`
My Framework Laptop 13 with a 13th-Gen Intel CPU, and a Japanese input cover.
Includes things like `eDP-1` for the embedded display, and a `jp` keyboard layout.
